# Memory-Game

This is a small and simple game that tests a person's ability of memorization.

The goal of the game will be to type in a randomly generated target string of characters after it is briefly displayed on the screen one letter at a time. 

The target string starts off as a single letter, but for each successful string entered, the game gets harder by making the target string longer.

Run MemoryGame.java file and specify the random seed as the input to the main method to start the game

HAVE FUN!!
